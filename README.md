# BoredFlix
# Description:  
Boredflix, as the name suggests, is an alternate for netflix, that takes a magnet source from you as input.  
The final release is enclosed with support for all operating systems: Windows, linux, MacOS, Android, iOS, which was the achilles heel of the previou releases, some of which only supported linux.  
For the final release, it has been coded using kivy, instead of tkinter, making it an all-round application.  
Also, in the new release, you get options to choose the desired magnet, which wasnt possible in the last release, making the final version more stable, faster, and effective.  

Note: This is not meant as a way to pirate, it is meant to be an educational project through and through. I do not condone pirating anything using BoredFlix in any way, which is why the source slot in the code has been left as "YOUR SOURCE HERE"

# Disclaimer:
This project is made exclusively for educational purposes. I, in no form condone piracy of any form. This project is just supposed to enhance my coding skills, and to serve as a roadmap, in case someone else wants to use this as reference for their own projects. Ideally, this project is meant for people who already have the movies, and want to stream it to their friends, instead of pirating it, and for them to host a magnet link for it and stream it without the need to pirate.
