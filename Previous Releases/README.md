# BoredFlix
# Description:  
Boredflix, as the name suggests, is an alternate for netflix, that searches piratebay for matches for a match with the user input.  
The final release is enclosed with support for all operating systems: Windows, linux, MacOS, Android, iOS, which was the achilles heel of the previou releases, some of which only supported linux.  
For the final release, it has been coded using kivy, instead of tkinter, making it an all-round application.  
Also, in the new release, you get options to choose the desired magnet, which wasnt possible in the last release, making the final version more stable, faster, and effective.  

Note: This is not meant as a way to pirate, it is meant to be an educational project through and through. I do not condone pirating anything using BoredFlix in any way, which is why I will be removing the sources before publishing.
